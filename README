Review#1
Unofrtunatly the app doesn't work on my emulator, I use genymotion emulator. 
I downloaded the entire folder and tried on different devices but it doesn't work. However, there was no errors or something wrong
with the code. The code is organized and I like the comments at the top of each section.
